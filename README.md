Info about hand-in:

- Game: Secret Hitler


Troubleshoot:

- Program crashes when booleans are to be reset, which does not allow for the game to be concluded.
- The game can only run for one round out of potentially 11 rounds. This is the reason for hardcoding choice of the president and chancellor. This means that the president and chancellor are the only ones who carry on the game. 
- Due to aforementioned issues, some code that requires several rounds of gameplay can not be reached e.g. inact policy.
- To receive data from the server, the client has to write and send data beforehand. 
- Graphs on GitHub do not properly represent the correct work distribution. Check wikis.
